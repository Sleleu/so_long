This is a project from 42 school, aiming to become familiar with some notions such as **window management, event handling, colors, textures, and so forth**.

For this small 2D game, we need to use the **MiniLibX**, a school graphical library. This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events.

The other goals are similar to every first projects of the common core of 42 : being rigorous, improving skills in C programming, use basic algorithms, do some information research, and so forth.

## The game

The playerâ€™s goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape chosing the shortest possible route.

It's possible to move the main character with **W,A,S,D**, the player cannot move into walls, and a number of mouvements is displayed in the shell>
